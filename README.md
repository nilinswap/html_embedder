# html_embedder

This is a dynamic webpage which simply runs the **html** code written on left side(just as it is) and shows it to  the right side. 
It uses **php** for its backend. An important html tag used is **<iframe>**.
### environment
If it says "file doesn't exist", try changing the ownership of embededpage.html to 777. I tried chmod in php but it did not work.
It requires newest php and a browser which can support iframe.
